Word Circle problem


Given a number (X) and a dictionary, write a program to find out whether the X number of valid words can be chained to form a circle. A word M can be put before another word N in a cicle if the last character of M is the same as the first character of N. 

Assume words are available in a dictionary.

Input: X = 4

Output: true 

The word circle can be chained as "for", "rig", "geek" and "kaf"

Feel free to be creative, considering options such as words of differing character lengths, memory and performance considerations for the project.
