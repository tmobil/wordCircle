Word Circle problem


Given a valid word in the dictionary, write a program to return the word circle. The word cicle contains valid words that can be chained to form a circle. A word M can be put before another word N in a cicle if the last character of M is the same as the first character of N. A word circle contains at least 3 vertices. Each vertex in the word circle is unique.

Assume words are available in a dictionary.

There may be multiple word circles avaiable for a given valid word. 
Please read words from the dictionary.

Feel free to be creative, considering options such as different design approaches, memory and performance considerations for the project.
